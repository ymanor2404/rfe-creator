- **M** (Medium): A clear need with some nuance. 3-5 acceptance criteria. Use the Standard format.
- **L** (Large): A significant need spanning multiple user scenarios. 5-8 acceptance criteria. Use the Full format.
- **XL** (Extra Large): A major initiative with broad impact. 8+ acceptance criteria. Use the Full format with all optional sections.
